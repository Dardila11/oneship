PRD: Modular Web App CLI Toolkit


1. Overview
Goal:
Build a CLI toolkit and framework for web developers to streamline the process of scaffolding, building, and deploying modern web applications. Unlike boilerplates, this toolkit is modular, extensible, and allows developers to choose and integrate their preferred libraries (auth, database, state management, etc.) or add their own.
Target Users:
Web developers (solo, teams, agencies)
Open-source contributors
Startups and product teams
2. Problem Statement
Developers waste time on repetitive setup, boilerplate, and integration work when starting new web projects. Existing solutions are either too opinionated (boilerplates) or too generic (manual setup). There is a need for a flexible, extensible CLI toolkit that provides best practices, modularity, and developer choice.
3. Product Objectives
Modular:
Each feature (auth, db, state, etc.) is a pluggable module.
Extensible:
Developers can create, share, and use custom modules.
Framework, not Boilerplate:
No hardcoded stack; instead, provide a framework for composition.
CLI-First:
All interactions via a powerful, user-friendly CLI.
Best Practices:
Scaffold projects with modern, production-ready defaults.
Customizable:
Allow deep configuration and overrides.
Composable:
Support for stacking and combining modules.
Ecosystem:
Registry for community modules and recipes.
4. Core Features
4.1 CLI Tooling
init: Start a new project, select modules interactively or via flags.
add <module>: Add features (auth, db, state, etc.) at any time.
remove <module>: Remove features cleanly.
list: Show installed and available modules.
upgrade: Update modules or the toolkit itself.
deploy: Integrate with deployment providers (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
doctor: Diagnose project health and suggest fixes.
4.2 Module System
Official Modules:
Auth, database, state management, UI, testing, etc.
Community Modules:
Discoverable via a registry.
Custom Modules:
Developers can author and publish their own.
Module API:
Standard interface for module lifecycle (install, configure, remove).
4.3 Extensibility
Hooks:
Lifecycle hooks for modules (pre/post install, build, deploy).
Config API:
Unified config file (e.g., toolkit.config.ts) for project settings.
Templates:
Support for custom file and code templates.
4.4 Developer Experience
Interactive Prompts:
For module selection and configuration.
TypeScript-First:
All code and templates in TypeScript.
Docs & Recipes:
Rich documentation and community-contributed recipes.
DX Utilities:
Linting, formatting, testing, and CI/CD integration.
5. Non-Goals
Not a monolithic boilerplate or locked-in stack.
Not a low-code/no-code tool.
Not focused on legacy tech (e.g., PHP, jQuery).
6. Technical Requirements
Node.js (latest LTS)
TypeScript (strict mode)
Pluggable CLI (e.g., built with oclif, commander, or custom)
Configurable via file and CLI
Extensible module/plugin system
Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
Open-source, MIT license
7. User Stories
As a developer, I want to scaffold a new project with only the features I need.
As a team, we want to enforce our own best practices via custom modules.
As a maintainer, I want to publish and share modules with the community.
As a developer, I want to swap out or upgrade modules (e.g., change auth provider) without rewriting my app.
8. Success Metrics
Time to first deploy (TTFD) is reduced by 50% compared to manual setup.
80%+ of users use at least one community or custom module.
90%+ CLI commands complete without errors in user testing.
100+ modules published in the first year.
9. Open Questions
How to handle breaking changes in modules?
How to ensure module compatibility and versioning?
What is the best way to support custom templates and code generation?
How to balance flexibility with sensible defaults?
10. Next Steps
Validate with target users (interviews, surveys)
Define MVP scope (core CLI, module system, 2-3 official modules)
Design CLI UX and module API
Build prototype and gather feedback
